# test-rmi-connection

RMI is a lightweight way of remote communication, unlike the RESTful HTTP API, RMI requires the use of JAVA on both sides.
We have a production environment where applications use RMI, recently we needed to perform a test to validate the connections.

The easiest way to validate was with a simple code, generate a jar and run it.
